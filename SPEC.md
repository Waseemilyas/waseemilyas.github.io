# Portfolio behaviour

Observed specification of the current public site; this does not change its copy or design.
Last verified: 2026-10-16 on Linux.

Visitors read the main pages, open anonymised case studies, browse published notes,
follow the Atom feed, inspect capabilities and find contact links. The source of
page membership is `src/`, navigation is `src/_data/site.json`, and page rendering
is owned by the shared layouts in `src/_includes/`. The feature map beside
[verify-portfolio](.agents/skills/verify-portfolio/SKILL.md) owns the executable journeys.

The site remains static HTML/CSS with progressive JavaScript enhancement. It has
no sign-in, database, submission backend or local persistent user state. Contact
links hand off to the visitor's mail application; verifying them does not send mail.
External links are destinations, not services this repository operates.

`setupNavigation` in `src/assets/js/site.js` owns the mobile drawer. Its
`setDrawer` function writes open/expanded/hidden/inert state. Escape returns focus
to the toggle. A link click closes it. Its media query and the stylesheet's mobile
query must agree. At desktop width the closed drawer's links become available
again. With JavaScript disabled, the footer navigation is the existing fallback;
the mobile toggle does not work. The design document already records that exception.

`setupCapabilityMap` owns panel selection and trace highlighting. The authored
content comes from `src/_data/capabilities.json` through `src/index.njk` data
attributes. Pointer selection, focus and Enter/Space activate a node. Selection
changes the panel and the highlighted connection without changing the route.
Without JavaScript, the first capability description is already rendered. On a narrow frame the same nodes are readable buttons instead of scaled SVG labels; selection, keyboard activation and the panel still belong to `setupCapabilityMap`.
`setupReveals` owns decorative entry motion; reduced motion reveals immediately.

`src/notes/posts/posts.11tydata.js` suppresses a draft's page permalink and excludes
it from collections. The notes collection also filters drafts in
`eleventy.config.js`. Notes listing, feed and sitemap consume those collections.
Publishing decisions belong to note front matter; navigation and generated-output
checks do not approve content. A clean build is the publication boundary.

Source privacy scanning cannot decide whether apparently anonymised copy identifies
a client. `AGENTS.md` owns that judgement and the grandfathered-content exception.
The rendered checker owns headings, metadata, links, feed/sitemap structure and
parity, draft absence and revision bytes. OG checks inspect image headers, not
pixel decoding. GitHub Pages serves the artifact built by the main workflow and
its post-deploy verifier compares the live revision body exactly.

The unlinked prayer-time audio files remain intentional HTTP assets. Browser
verification checks that they are served, without playback or touching the external
consumer. Build and release inputs are in `package.json`, the lockfile and the
workflows; their versions and retry limits are read there.

The separate `e2e/` Playwright journey exercises main-page reading, primary
navigation, phone drawer focus recovery and capability selection at desktop and
phone widths. It requires an explicit target and full expected revision, blocks
writes and external requests, and retains screenshots for visual inspection.
Its invocation and limits are in `e2e/README.md`; root CI does not invoke it.
